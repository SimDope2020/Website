                <h3>Lamborghini</h3>
            <p>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 
                with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings 
                from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 
                GT, were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. 
                Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear 
                mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.</p>
            <h3>Aventador SVJ</h3>
            <p>Unveiled at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the Aventador SVJ (Super Veloce Jota) 
                is a track focused iteration of the Aventador S and an improvement over the Aventador SV. 
                The 6.5-litre L539 V12 engine used in the entire Aventador lineage has been reworked and 
                now generates a maximum power output of 770 PS (566 kW; 759 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 720 N·m 
                (531 lb·ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm. The weight saving measures such as the extensive use of 
                carbon fibre and titanium in the exhaust system has brought the weight down to 1,525 kg 
                (3,362 lb), giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 1.98 kg/hp. The Aventador SVJ can 
                accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.6 
                seconds and can attain a top speed of over 349 km/h (217 mph).</p>
            <h3>Urus</h3>
            <p>The Lamborghini Urus is an SUV manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini. 
                It was unveiled on 4 December 2017 and was put on the market for the 2018 model year. 
                The name comes from the Urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs. 
                The Lamborghini Urus does not use Lamborghini's hallmark of naturally aspirated V10 
                (as used in the concept) or V12 engines. Instead, the Urus is powered by a 650 PS (641 hp; 478 kW) 
                4.0 L twin-turbocharged V8, a modified version of Audi's 4.0 L V8.</p>

                <h3>Historty</h3>
                <p>In August 1919, W.O. registered Bentley Motors Ltd. 
                    and in October he exhibited a car chassis, with dummy engine, 
                    at the London Motor Show. Ex–Royal Flying Corps officer 
                    Clive Gallop designed an innovative four valves per cylinder 
                    engine for the chassis. By December the engine was built and running. 
                    Delivery of the first cars was scheduled for June 1920, but development 
                    took longer than estimated so the date was extended to September 1921. 
                    The durability of the first Bentley cars earned widespread acclaim and they 
                    competed in hill climbs and raced at Brooklands.</p>
                <h3>Continental GT W12</h3>
                <p>The press release announcing a third-generation Continental GT was made on 29 August 2017. 
                    The model made its physical debut when it was unveiled at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show 
                    where it drew a "huge crowd." Production began in 2018 with a base price of GB£156,700. 
                    In January 2019, Bentley announced it would celebrate its 100th birthday with a 
                    limited-edition car, likely based on the Continental GT, to debut at the Geneva auto show. 
                    November 2018 saw the debut of a 2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible, to go on sale in 
                    2019. The model shares the Volkswagen-developed MSB platform with the second-generation 
                    Porsche Panamera. Compared to previous models, the car features a lighter body 
                    (>80 kg (176.4 lb)), an extended wheelbase (135 mm (5.3 in)), a 48-volt roll-control system 
                    and a new 6.0-litre W12 TSI engine, as well as a significant interior overhaul including an 
                    industry first rotating display. The Continental GT is the first production car ever to 
                    have an entire body side made from the Super Formed process; a precision technique with 
                    aluminium which allows more complex, sharply defined body lines. Unlike prior models, the 
                    panels are "superformed" with heated aluminum sheets molded by gas instead of a stamp. 
                    Manufacturer's figures indicate 0-60 mph takes 3.6 seconds (3.7 seconds 0–100 km/h) and it 
                    is capable of reaching a top speed of 333 km/h (207 mph). The W12 engine - designed, 
                    developed, and handbuilt in Crewe - is a further enhanced version of the TSI engine 
                    launched in the Bentayga in 2016. Featuring high- and low- pressure direct fuel injection, 
                    a variable displacement system, stop-start technology and launch mode, the powertrain 
                    produces 635 PS (626 hp) and 900 N·m (664 lb·ft) of torque.</p>
                <h3>Bentayga</h3>
                <p>The Bentley Bentayga is a mid-size, front-engine, all-wheel drive, 
                    five-door luxury crossover SUV marketed by British car manufacturer Bentley, 
                    beginning with model year 2016. Its body is manufactured at the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel 
                    plant, then painted by Paintbox Editions in Banbury, and finally assembled at the 
                    company's Crewe factory. Starting in 2017, the Bentayga received an additional powertrain: 
                    a diesel V8 derived from the VW Group diesel V8. This engine (in production since February 2017) 
                    is Bentley's first-ever diesel, and the Bentayga is only Bentley offered with a diesel powertrain. 
                    A Bentayga Diesel is identified by either the optional badge on the front wing, or the trapezoid quad 
                    exhaust tips. The performance of 4.0 L, twin-turbo version of the Bentayga include 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) 
                    in 4.6 seconds (0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.8 s) and a top speed of 168 mph (270 km/h).</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Henry Ford's first attempt at a car company under his own name was the Henry Ford Company on November 3, 1
                901, which became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name. 
                The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in 
                cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). 
                The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen to assuage investors' 
                fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, 
                the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on Piquette 
                Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it 
                from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade, the company 
                would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon 
                brought much of the part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era.</p>
            <h3>GT</h3>
            <p>The Ford GT is an American mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured and marketed by Ford for model 
                year 2005 in conjunction with the company's 2003 centenary. The second generation Ford GT became available 
                for the 2017 model year. The longitudinal rear mounted Modular 5.4 L V8 engine 
                is all-aluminum alloy engine with an Eaton 2300 Lysholm screw-type supercharger. 
                It features a forged rotating assembly housed in an aluminum block designed specifically for the car. 
                A dry sump oiling system is employed, allowing the engine to sit low in the car's frame. 
                The DOHC 4 valves per cylinder heads are a revision of the 2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R 
                cylinder heads (with slightly increased wall casting thickness in the exhaust port). 
                The camshafts have unique specifications, with more lift and duration than those found in the Shelby GT500. 
                Power output is 550 hp (410 kW; 558 PS) at 6,500 rpm and 500 lb·ft (678 N·m) of torque at 4,500 rpm. 
                A Ricardo 6-speed manual transmission is fitted featuring a helical limited-slip differential. 
                Car and Driver tested the GT in January 2004 and recorded a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 3.3 seconds.</p>
            <h3>Mustang</h3>
            <p>The sixth generation Mustang was unveiled on December 5, 2013, in Dearborn, 
                Michigan; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; Barcelona, Spain; Shanghai, 
                China; and Sydney, Australia. The internal project code name is S-550.
                Changes include widened body by 1.5 inches, 1.4 inches lower body, trapezoidal grille, and 
                a 2.75-inch lower decklid, as well as new colors. The passenger volume is increased to 84.5 
                cubic feet, wheelbase is still 8 ft. 11.1 in. (107.1 in.), and three engine options are 
                available: a newly developed 2.3 L EcoBoost 310 hp four-cylinder introduced to reach high 
                tariff global markets like China, 3.7 L 300 hp V6, or 5.0 L Coyote 435 hp V8, with either a 
                Getrag six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. 
                    Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's 
                    race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company 
                    built its first car in 1940.</p>
                <h3>Ferrari 458</h3>
                    <p>In Ferrari's first official announcement of the car, 
                        the 458 was described as the successor to the F430 
                        but arising from an entirely new design, incorporating 
                        technologies developed from the company's experience in Formula One. 
                        The 458 is powered by a 4,497 cc (4.5 L; 274.4 cu in) engine of the 
                        "Ferrari/Maserati" F136 V8 family, generating a power 
                        output of 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) at 9,000 rpm (redline) 
                        and 540 N·m (398 lb·ft) of torque at 6,000 rpm[9] with 80% 
                        torque available at 3,250 rpm.[8] The engine features direct fuel injection, 
                        which is a first for Ferrari mid-engine setups in its road cars.</p>
                <h3>California T</h3>
                <p>The Ferrari California (Type F149) is a grand touring sports car 
                    produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer Ferrari. 
                    It is a two-door 2+2 hard top convertible. When originally unveiled, 
                    the California was powered by a front-mid mounted, rear wheel drive, 
                    naturally aspirated 4.3-litre V8. In 2012 a lighter, slightly more 
                    powerful variant, the California 30 was introduced. In 2014, Ferrari 
                    announced the second generation of the model, named California T powered 
                    by a new twin-turbo 3.9-litre V8. The updated engine continued with the naturally 
                    aspirated Ferrari/Maserati F136. Made entirely of aluminium, it retains many of 
                    the original features but generates a maximum power output of 360 kW (489 PS; 483 hp) 
                    at 7,750 rpm; its maximum torque produced is 505 Nm (372 ft-lbs) at 5,000 rpm. 
                    75% of which is available at 2,250 rpm. The engine's sound - a feature that 
                    distinguishes every Ferrari - was engineered to enhance the vehicle's driving 
                    experience both with the top open and closed.</p>

                <h3>Mercedes SLR</h3>
                <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren (C199 / R199 / Z199) is a grand tourer jointly 
                    developed by German automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz and British automobile 
                    manufacturer McLaren Automotive and sold from 2003 to 2010. When the car was developed, 
                    Mercedes-Benz owned 40 percent of the McLaren Group and the car was produced 
                    in conjunction between the two companies. SLR is an abbreviation for "Sport 
                    Leicht Rennsport" (Sport Light Racing), a homage to the Mercedes-Benz 300 
                    SLR which served as the car's inspiration. The car was offered in coupé, 
                    roadster and speedster bodystyles with the latter being a limited edition model.</p>
                <h3>McLaren P1</h3>
                <p>The McLaren P1 is a limited-production plug-in hybrid sports car produced by British 
                    automobile manufacturer McLaren Automotive. Debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, 
                    sales of the P1 began in the United Kingdom in October 2013 and all 375 units were sold out by November. 
                    Production ended in early December 2015. The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%. 
                    The P1 features a 3.8 L; 231.8 cu in (3,799 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The twin turbos boost 
                    the petrol engine at 1.4 bar (20.3 psi) to deliver 737 PS (542 kW; 727 hp) at 7,500 rpm and 
                    531 lb·ft (720 N·m) of torque at 4,000 rpm, combined with an in-house-developed electric 
                    motor producing 179 PS (132 kW; 177 hp) and 192 lb·ft (260 N·m) of torque. 
                    The electric motor and the petrol engine in the P1, produce a combined power 
                    output of 916 PS (674 kW; 903 hp) and 723 lb·ft (980 N·m) of torque. The electric motor can 
                    be deployed manually by the driver or left in automatic mode, whereby the car's ECUs 
                    'torque fill' the gaps in the petrol engine's output, which is considered turbo lag. 
                    This gives the powertrain an effective powerband of almost 7,000 rpm. The car has rear-wheel-drive 
                    layout and is equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission developed by Graziano Trasmissioni.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Christian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion 
            animated movie Pinchcliffe Grand Prix in his youth. He took his first steps in the world of business 
            in his early 20s running a trading company called Alpraaz in Stockholm, Sweden. 
            Alpraaz exported food from Europe to the developing world. The success of this 
            venture gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch his chosen career as a car manufacturer.</p>
        <h3>Regera</h3>
        <p>The Koenigsegg Regera is a limited production, plug-in hybrid grand touring sports car manufactured 
            by Swedish automotive manufacturer Koenigsegg. It was unveiled at the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show. 
            The name Regera is a Swedish verb, meaning "to reign" or "to rule." Koenigsegg only plans to produce 80 
            units of the car, all of which have been sold. The Regera has a reported total power output of 1,340 kW 
            (1,797 hp; 1,822 PS) through a hybrid powertrain. As in general, the Regera's internal combustion engine 
            (ICE) generates its greatest power only at high rpm; however, due to the fixed gear, this 
            corresponds to very high speeds. Power at low speeds is filled in by the electric motors, giving a 
            maximum combined mechanical power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) and 2,000 N·m (1,475 lb·ft) of torque.</p>
        <h3>Jesko</h3>
        <p>The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish 
            automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg. Introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the car succeeds the Agera. 
            The name Jesko is a tribute to the company founder's father, Jesko von Koenigsegg. The engine is a development 
            of the 5.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the Agera. It has four valves per cylinder each with a 
            bore and stroke of 92 mm × 95.25 mm (3.62 by 3.75 inches) and a compression ratio of 8.6:1. The engine has a 
            power output of 1,298 PS (955 kW; 1,280 hp) on normal gasoline and has a power output of 1,622 PS (1,193 kW; 1,600 hp) 
            and 1,573 N·m (1,160 lb·ft) of torque at 5,100 rpm on E85 biofuel.</p>
